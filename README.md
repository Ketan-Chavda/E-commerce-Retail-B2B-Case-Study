E-Commerce & Retail B2B Case Study
# Business Understanding
• Schuster is a multinational retail company dealing in sports goods and accessories. Schuster conducts significant business with hundreds of its vendors, with whom it has credit arrangements.

• In a B2C business, when a company sells its goods or services directly to its end users and charges for them, the transactions occur instantly, and in most cases, the transactions’ value is collected immediately. Generally, in B2C business, the transaction amounts are less.

• However, when a company provides its goods to other businesses and vendors, the transaction amounts are high. To maintain good relationships, companies often do business on credit. Therefore, there is a risk of collecting money from vendors on time to run the business smoothly.

# Problem Statement
Schuster is a multinational retailer of sports goods and garments. It conducts significant business with hundreds of vendors with whom it has arranged a credit arrangement.

• However, not all its vendors respect the credit terms and tend to make late payments. While Schuster imposes a fine for every late payment made by the vendor, but such an approach is not seemingly beneficial for the long-term relationships of either of the parties.

• The collectors (Schuster employees who collect and reconcile the payments against the invoices raised) must keep chasing the vendors to ensure the payment is received on time. In case of late payments, they spend considerable time coordinating the payments. This resulted in many non-value-added activities, loss of time and effort and financial impact on Schuster.

# Goal
• Schuster would like to understand more about the customer payment behavior based on their past payment pattern (Customer segmentation)

• Using historical information, Schuster will be able to predict the likelihood of delay of payment of open invoices from the customers.

• Using this information, collectors can prioritize their work in following up with the customers beforehand to get the payment on time.
